# Smart-irrigation-System
Components Required for the Automatic Irrigation System
The project requires very few components and the connection is also very simple. The components are listed below:

Arduino * 1
moisture sensor * 1
5v relay module * 1
6v Mini water pump with small pipe * 1
Connecting wires
5v battery * 1

 The Arduino UNO is the brain of this whole project. It controls the motor pump according to the moisture in the soil which is given by the moisture sensor.
To power the circuit, I am using an external Battery. You can use any 9v or 12-volt battery. The battery is connected to the Vin and ground pins of Arduino and we can also connect the motor to this battery via a relay. Moisture sensor output is connected to the analog pin of Arduino.
